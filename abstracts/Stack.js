//A list that operates under the LIFO principle

//Think of an array that pushes and pops from the top. Push and Pop

/*
Analogy from Processing for Java Docs, in context of a transformation matrix
These come from a computer concept known as a stack, 
which works like a spring-loaded tray dispenser in a cafeteria. 
When someone returns a tray to the stack, its weight pushes the platform down. 
When someone needs a tray, he takes it from the top of the stack, 
and the remaining trays pop up a little bit.
