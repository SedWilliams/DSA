//Think of a stack that operates under FIFO instead of LIFO

//The first object to have entered the queue will be the first to leave

//You are popping (dequeueing) from the bottom of the stack but pushing (enqueueing) to the top 

//The object at the front of the queue is known as the head
//And the Object at the back of the queue is known as the tail
